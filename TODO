* normal mcts test
* robber evaluation after every card
* road evaluation after every road?
* mcts children - check for use of "pos"
* mcts tests for performance
* can write random vs baseline - wins, points, # of turns?
* random event node: no ucb, just a random sample
* each node as possible decision point
* multiple threads go to the tree in parallel, backtrack all at once

MCTS done by end of next week for experiment

removed stealing for now. TODO: bring it back

BUGS:
* dev cards can be used the turn they are played
* random choice for the robber is not implemented for MCTS

get actions from each node
MCTS - disable dev cards for now

hill climbing - change one constant at a time in either direction
take best strategy as new benchmark
random starting points for hill climbing - are they optimized or do we need something more like a genetic algo?
want to get a good benchmark opponent for MCTS (future work) - can look at what other people are using for benchmarks
can possibly implement a new benchmark

rough draft of report done by tues may 2nd

TODO
* run tests on them
* create poster
* final report
