* normal mcts test
* robber evaluation after every card
* road evaluation after every road?
* mcts children - check for use of "pos"
* mcts tests for performance
* can write random vs baseline - wins, points, # of turns?
* random event node: no ucb, just a random sample
* each node as possible decision point
* multiple threads go to the tree in parallel, backtrack all at once

MCTS done by end of next week for experiment

removed stealing for now. TODO: bring it back

BUGS:
* dev cards can be used the turn they are played
* random choice for the robber is not implemented for MCTS

get actions from each node
MCTS - disable dev cards for now
